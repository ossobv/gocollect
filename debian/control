Description: Collect rarely changing system info for server mapping.
 GoCollect collects various pieces of system info and publishes them to
 a central server.
 .
 The intent of GoCollect is to create a map of your servers with slow
 and never changing data items. Where you may use Zabbix for
 semi-realtime monitoring of integer values like current CPU usage, you
 use GoCollect to collect values like hard drive serial numbers, IPMI
 IP-addresses and versions of installed OS packages.
