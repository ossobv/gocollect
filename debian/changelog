gocollect (0.4.0-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Create v0.4.0 release.
    - Use iproute|iproute2 dependency for wheezy/jessie compat.
    - Use module-init-tools|kmod dependency for precise-ubuntu.
    - Don't depend on lshw explicitly because values from there are
      not mandatory (and it flaps because of CPU-speed changes).
  * Split up into three packages:
    - gocollect - core
    - gocollect-hardware - dependencies on things like ipmitools
      (only needed on non-virtual hosts)
    - gocollect-osso - common OSSO B.V. configuration
  * Add 99gocollect-restart to apt.conf.d to auto-restart gocollect
    after apt runs. (Don't fail if it fails.)
