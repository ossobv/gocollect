gocollect (0.6.0-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Create v0.6.0-1 release. See CHANGES.rst for the changes.
  * Notable changes: gocollect now supports builtin (golang) collectors.
    The first one is 'core.meta' which now tries to read from
    /etc/gocollect/core.meta/*.yaml. For backwards compatibility,
    /var/lib/gocollect/core.meta.js is still preferred if it exists.
  * Uses Recommends instead of Depends for most collector dependencies.

gocollect (0.5.0-2) stable; urgency=medium

  * Remove apt repository alter hack again. This was only needed in the
    'osso' component on the OSSO ppa server.

gocollect (0.5.0-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Create v0.5.0-1 release.
    - core: Added 'api_key' key in the config file to set the API key to
      authenticate to the collector server.
    - core: Added 'include' directive in the config file (no globbing) to
      include single files like /etc/gocollect.conf.local.
    - core: Force really-really static go executable.

    - release: Experiment with increasing version numbers for releases of
      the same build on different operating system versions.

    - core.meta: Add optional custom (node-specific) data to be passed.
    - os.distro: Prefer os-release over lsb_release parsing.
    - os.storage: Reduce fluctuating listings (zfs, magicfs, tmpfs).
    - app.lshw: Mask out the CPU clock speed that fluctuates.

  * Fix lintian issues:
    - E: gocollect changes: bad-distribution-in-changes-file stable;
      by putting "UNRELEASED" there.
    - W: gocollect: hardening-no-relro usr/sbin/gocollect;
      by adding it to the ignore list.

  * Attempt systemctl before initctl. Should ease release-upgrades.

  * Update the apt repository in the sources.lists through postinst.
    This is a temp hack!

gocollect (0.4.0-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Create v0.4.0 release.
    - Use iproute|iproute2 dependency for wheezy/jessie compat.
    - Use module-init-tools|kmod dependency for precise-ubuntu.
    - Don't depend on lshw explicitly because values from there are
      not mandatory (and it flaps because of CPU-speed changes).
  * Split up into three packages:
    - gocollect - core
    - gocollect-hardware - dependencies on things like ipmitools
      (only needed on non-virtual hosts)
    - gocollect-osso - common OSSO B.V. configuration
  * Add 99gocollect-restart to apt.conf.d to auto-restart gocollect
    after apt runs. (Don't fail if it fails.)
