GoCollect example server implementations
========================================

* rmq2file: File storage from RabbitMQ storage
  (incomplete without GoCollect to RabbitMQ storage).

* wsgi2file: Most basic example, taking data from the nodes to file
  storage directly.


TODO
----

* Fix wsgi2file to actually work.

* Fix problems with missing hostnames?
